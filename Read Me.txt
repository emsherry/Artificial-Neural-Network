*****ANN Implementation on Tic Tac Toe*****

Our implementatiion is through 9-3-1 technique

In the first part  of the code we created a simple tic tac toe  game 

After that we started working on ANN (Activation Function used  is Sigmoid)
1.Forward Feed
a.Randomn weights 
b.Input from file 
c.Error calculation through output node

2.Backward Propagation
a.Used the error to modify weights and make them right 
b.Modified hidden layer nodes 

3. Training
a.Trained our ANN using the data provided

4.Implementation on Tic Tac Toe
a.Made a training part where we passed the board on to go through the ANN.
b.Calculated the probability of every empty node and marked through the computer wherever the probability is highest.

5.Happy Tic Tac Toe
